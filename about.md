Hi, my name is Tom!  I am a Data Science Fellow at General Assembly, learning about data analysis techniques and best practices using Python, Pandas, SciKitLearn, and a slew of other packages/utilities/technologies.  I'm currently trying to get this blog up and running in my spare time so bare with me as this all comes together. Thanks for visiting!
